This is a brief introduction to DMDirc's developers.

I'm **Chris**, aka **MD87**.  I'm the "core" developer of DMDirc, which means
I'm responsible for most of the back-end logic, handling data storage, and a
small mountain of others things.  I'm also apparently the best writer, so I'll
probably be the one who posts most to this blog.

Next up, we have **Shane**, aka **Dataforce**.  He's primarily in charge of the
IRC Parser (the code that interfaces between the client and the IRC server), but
is also working on the plugins system, and writing the logging plugin.  You can
identity Shane's code by the length of lines and the number of code conventions
it breaks (if there are >300 char lines, and it breaks every convention you can
think of, it's probably his).

Last but not least, there's **Greg**, aka **Greboid**.  He's in charge of the
client user interface, and can often be found complaining on IRC about problems
he's having with it (his latest favourite subject is the TextPane rewrite we
have scheduled for 0.4).

So, that's us.  We can all be found on IRC, in #DMDirc on Quakenet
(irc.quakenet.org) among other places. We can also be contacted via e-mail by
prepending our name (as above) to @dmdirc.com.
