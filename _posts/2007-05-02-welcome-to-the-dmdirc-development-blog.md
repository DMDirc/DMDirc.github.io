title: Welcome to the DMDirc development blog

Welcome to the DMDirc development blog.  The idea behind this blog to allow us, the developers, to show off new features we're implementing, discuss various aspects of IRC and writing an IRC client, and to get some feedback from our users. We'll try to make semi-regular posts to keep everyone up to date with the client's status.

If you want to try the features we're describing, you can try a nightly build, as explained on the [development page](http://www.dmdirc.com/development.html) of our main website.  Please note that nightly builds may be horrendously buggy, so don't be hugely surprised if one of them deletes your config files, makes your screen turn red, or sacrifices your first born child to the gods of IRC.

If you have any questions about DMDirc, want us to blog about anything in particular, or just want to chat, you can find all of the developers in #dmdirc on Quakenet (irc.quakenet.org).
