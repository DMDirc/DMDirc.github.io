DMDirc 0.8 was released on the 27th of February.

This release mostly focused on cleaning up a lot of DMDirc's internals. This makes the DMDirc code base a lot more maintainable, and is a significant step towards having a stable API for the client which plugins can rely on. Unfortunately this means there are not many user-visible changes this time!

New in 0.8 is a revamped error reporting back-end, which allows the developers to much more easily track and address issues in the client. This will ensure bugs are tracked down and fixed much more quickly in the future.

This release also contains a number of fixes for OS X support, and increases the minimum version of Java that we require from 6 to 7
