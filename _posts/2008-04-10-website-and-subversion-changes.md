<p>As you may have noticed if you're a regular visitor, the DMDirc website has recently been given a lick of paint. There is now a common header across all of the DMDirc sites (the main website, addons site, bug tracker and blog), which allows easy navigation between all aspects of the DMDirc website, and is a lot better looking than the old header, too!</p><p>We have also relocated our subversion repository from its previous home at Google's Project Hosting service, to our own server. We made this switch because of the fairly poor uptime of Google's offering, and the seemingly random delays between commits being made and announcement e-mails being sent. If you have the DMDirc source code checked out from our subversion repository, follow the instructions <a href="http://www.dmdirc.com/svn">here</a> to migrate to the new repository.</p>
