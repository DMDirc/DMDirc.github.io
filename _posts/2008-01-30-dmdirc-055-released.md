title: DMDirc 0.5.5 Released
---
We have just released version 0.5.5 of DMDirc.  This release is an interim release between 0.5.1 and 0.6 to get some important features of 0.6 in use in the stable version.

Some of the main changes include:
<ul>
	<li> The new launchers which give the client the ability to update itself via the updater</li>
	<li> URL Handler to allow adding support for non-http links (Eg steam://, ftp://)</li>
	<li> Much improved plugin system (Plugins are now stored in jar files rather than loads of .class files)</li>
	<li> Many more, read the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmdirc/wiki/ChangelogNoughtPointFivePointFive">changelog</a> for a full list.
</ul>

The installer for DMDirc 0.5.5 can be downloaded for <a href="http://dmdirc.googlecode.com/files/DMDirc-0.5.5-Setup.exe">Windows</a> or <a href="http://dmdirc.googlecode.com/files/DMDirc-0.5.5-Setup.run">Linux</a>.
