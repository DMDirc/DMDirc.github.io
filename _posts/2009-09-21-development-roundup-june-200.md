Regular visitors to our blog may have noticed a lack of development roundups over the past few months. This was due to some non-DMDirc commitments/difficulties experienced by some of the developers. Never fear, though, we're now back and gearing up for DMDirc 0.6.3m2, which should be out on the 1st of November according to our <a href="{% post_url 2009-07-05-improving-the-dmdirc-release-cycle %}">release schedule</a>. We'll try to clear up the backlog of roundups over the next few days.

So, going back to June. Almost the entire month was spent in a feature freeze for DMDirc 0.6.3m1. We made around 70 commits to our git repository, fixing a large number of bugs ranging from typos, to windowing/title problems, and various minor UI tweaks.

On the 28th of June, we released <a href="{% post_url 2009-06-28-dmdirc-063m1-released %}">DMDirc 0.6.3m1</a>, the full changelog for which can be seen <a href="http://wiki.dmdirc.com/documentation:changelogs:0.6.3m1">on the wiki</a>.
