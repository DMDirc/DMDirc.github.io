If you're reading this via our website, you may have already noticed that DMDirc has undergone a small re-branding. We now use the tagline "the intelligent IRC client" across all the DMDirc sites (apart from the <a href="http://addons.dmdirc.com/">addons site</a> which is undergoing an overhaul â€” you can take a sneak peak at what it's going to be like over at the <a href="http://addons-dev.dmdirc.com/">development site</a>). This tagline has also found its way into the 'About' dialog in recent nightly builds.

Why "the intelligent IRC client"? Well, we think DMDirc's built-in 'intelligence' is the most significant aspect that sets it apart from other clients. We've yet to see another IRC client that has tab-completion anywhere near the quality of DMDirc's, or that parses links as well as we do. We have more enhancements coming for both of these areas, too, as well as plans to make other DMDirc features more 'intelligent'.

While the two areas mentioned above may not seem ground-shatteringly important, they improve the usability of the client quite a lot. The difference they make is most noticeable when you use another IRC client, and find that you can no longer tab-complete command names, or that a link in the topic includes a closing quotation mark when you click on it, which means you have to do something extra (open the manual to look up the command name, manually copy the URL or modify it in the browser, etc) in order to do/find out what you want, instead of it just working.

DMDirc 0.6 (coming soon; we're going to be pushing out an alpha version this weekend) features a lot of enhancements to the 'intelligent' aspects of DMDirc, some of which we've <a href="http://blog.dmdirc.com/2008/02/13/even-more-intelligent-tab-completion/">discussed previously</a>. But, as always, we'd love to hear from you if you have any suggestions on how we could make DMDirc more intelligent.
