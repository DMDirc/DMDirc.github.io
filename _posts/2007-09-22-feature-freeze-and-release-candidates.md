DMDirc has now entered Feature Freeze for the 0.5 release (for more information
about our release cycle, see
[this blog post]({% post_url 2007-06-08-the-dmdirc-release-cycle %})).

New for this release we have decided to build Release Candidate builds
approximately every day. Release Candidate builds are just like the final
release: they are installed using the new installer, and they are feature
complete for 0.5. Their purpose is help discover/iron out any last bugs before
we tag and release 0.5 into the wild and begin on 0.6.

RC1 was released yesterday (Downloads:
[Linux](http://dmdirc.googlecode.com/files/installer.0.5RC1.run) and
[Windows](http://dmdirc.googlecode.com/files/installer.0.5RC1.exe) with RC2
hopefully being ready tonight.

Once we get an RC build with no apparent bugs, we will release 0.5 :)
