DMDirc has now entered Feature Freeze for the 0.5 release (for more information about our release cycle, see <a href="{% post_url 2007-06-08-the-dmdirc-release-cycle %}">this blog post</a>).

New for this release we have decided to build Release Candidate builds approximately every day.
Release Candidate builds are just like the final release: they are installed using the new installer, and they are feature complete for 0.5. Their purpose is help discover/iron out any last bugs before we tag and release 0.5 into the wild and begin on 0.6.

RC1 was released yesterday (Downloads: <a href="http://dmdirc.googlecode.com/files/installer.0.5RC1.run">Linux</a> and <a href="http://dmdirc.googlecode.com/files/installer.0.5RC1.exe">Windows</a>) with RC2 hopefully being ready tonight.

Once we get an RC build with no apparent bugs, we will release 0.5 :)
